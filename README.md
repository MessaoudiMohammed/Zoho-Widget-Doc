 # Introduction 

        Welcome to the Zoho Widgets development guide! This documentation will walk you through the steps to get started with developing widgets using ReactJS for Zoho applications.

        ## Prerequisites

        Before we begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

        ### 1. Node.js
        Node.js is essential for running JavaScript code outside the browser and managing packages with npm (Node Package Manager).

        - [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
        - After installation, verify it by running the following command in your terminal:
          ```bash
          node -v
          ```

        ### 2. Zet CLI
        Zet CLI is used to scaffold and manage your Zoho widgets project.

        - Install Zet CLI
          ```bash
          npm install -g zoho-extension-toolkit
          ```
        - Once installed, you can verify by running:
          ```bash
          zet -v
          ```

        ### 3. GitHub Desktop
        GitHub Desktop allows you to manage your code and collaborate with others using Git.

        - [Download and Install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
        - After installation, link your GitHub account and configure Git.

        **PS:** Before installing GitHub Desktop, you should create a GitHub account so I can add you as a collaborator to the projects.

        ### 4. Cloning an Existing Project using GitHub Desktop

        After GitHub Desktop is installed and configured, follow these steps to clone an existing project:

        1. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub account.
        2. Click **File** > **Clone Repository**.
        3. In the "Clone a Repository" window, choose the repository you want to clone from the list or enter the repository URL.
        4. Select the local path where you want to save the project.
        5. Click **Clone** to download the project to your local machine.
